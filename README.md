# 2D-3D-Graphics-Engine

This Project describes the design and development details of hardware and software components required for 
interfacing LPCXpresso 1769 with SPI enabled TFT LCD. The graphical LCD is an 18-bit color TFT display. 
This Project mainly presents implementation, design and testing of 3D graphics implementation on LPCXpresso 
CPU module and LCD as output terminal. A 3D cube with different 2D graphics on each of its face has been
implemented by communicating with SPI bus of LPC1769 module.

Apparatus:
1. LPC1769 MCU
2. Adafruit 3.2 TFT LCD Display
3. 7805 Volatage Regulator
4. 12 V DC Adapter/ USB cable
5. Wire wrapping board
6. Connecting wires & Soldering ion & solder wire
7. LED
8. Resistors & Capacitors
9. Switch
